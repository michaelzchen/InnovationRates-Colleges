                   Raj Chetty's Opportunity Insights) and institution level data obtained 
                   from College Scorecard. With so much scrutiny going into whether college 
                   is really worth it or not, the key factor that most researchers have 
                   been examining is the earnings of students right out of college - this 
                   is the most common barometer of success. However, having read Andrew Yang's
                   book 'Smart People Should Build Things', my main concern with the 'outcome'
                   of college is whether people are creating something of value - I define value
                   as higher innovation rates (which is measured through number of patents registered).
                   Throughout the project, I will run regressions on various data for innovation 
                   rates (total number of patents granted to sstudents, share of inventors among 
                   students, total number of patent citations obtained by students, etc.) and

                   SAT/ACT score, percentage of degrees awarded in various fields)."),

                   they attended, where college is what place each child attends as the institution the child
                   attended for the greatest amount of time during the 4 calendar years in which the child 
                   turned 19-22. The most important variable is called 'inventor' and represents the share of
